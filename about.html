      <h2>Crafting Wine Stories Since 1994</h2>
      <p>
       Afta 94 (Pty) Ltd is a proudly Black woman-led business, with Afta 94 Wines as its flagship brand. Founded by Lindiwe M, our brand lives by the inspiring tagline:

“Make Dreams Real.”
      </p>
      <h2> Our Founder’s Journey</h2>
      <p>Lindiwe was born in Soweto (Emdeni). At age seven, she moved to the Free State town of Kwakwatsi, where she was lovingly raised by her uncle, Ruben Sebiloane, then a school principal. She began her education at Bantu Primary School before returning to Soweto to complete her matric at Seana-Marena High School.</p>
      <p>
        In 1990, Lindiwe relocated to Palm Springs township in the Vaal. Before South Africa’s historic 1994 democratic elections, she volunteered to assist her community with acquiring identity documents, helping many exercise their right to vote for the first time.</p>

        <p>By 1997, Lindiwe secured her first government position as a Youth Sport Organiser at Gauteng Provincial Government’s Department of Sport, Recreation, Arts, and Culture. Over the years, she gained extensive experience in event management and held various leadership roles. Alongside her career, she earned a BTech degree in Public Management, majoring in Strategic Management, and completed several professional certifications. Her proudest career moments include working on the 1998 World Cup in Athletics, the African Cup of Nations, the National Masakhane Games, and the iconic 2010 FIFA World Cup.</p>
      <h2>From Challenges to New Beginnings</h2>
      <p>In 2014, Lindiwe shifted her focus to property development, but the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 forced her to temporarily close the business. During this time, she cared for her ailing mother until she passed away peacefully in August 2022.</p>
      <p>While grieving, sipping her favourite wine, reliving her mother's memories, and listening to Luther Vandross, Lindiwe reflected deeply on her life, her journey, and the values her mother instilled—faith, resilience, and hope. Inspired, she decided to start her own wine brand to celebrate her story and inspire future generations. That’s how Afta 94 was born.</p>
      <p>To deepen her knowledge, Lindiwe earned Level 1 and 2 wine certification from Wines of South Africa (WOSA) and completed the Small Steps to Success program with SheTrades International Trade Centre.</p>
      <h2>Our Mission: Breaking Barriers and Making Dreams Real</h2>
      <p>South Africa’s wine industry has long been dominated by white male ownership—for over 369 years, vineyards have rarely changed hands. Transformation remains slow, and Black-owned wine brands face significant challenges, including high winery prices and pressure to sell at low margins locally and internationally.</p>
      <p>Afta 94 Wines is committed to changing this narrative. Our mission is to create opportunities, support disadvantaged communities, and contribute to South Africa’s economy by celebrating Black excellence and entrepreneurship in the wine industry.</p>

      <h2>A Dream Realized—After 1994</h2>
      <p>Lindiwe’s journey—from education and first job to marriage, purchasing land, registering companies, and finally owning a wine brand—has all happened after South Africa’s first democratic elections in 1994.</p>
      <p>No matter how big or small your achievements, whether here in South Africa or abroad, every milestone deserves celebration. And what better way to celebrate than with a glass of Afta 94 Wine?</p>
